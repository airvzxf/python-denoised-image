# Python: Denoised an image



### The statement

An image can be seen as bitmap or a matrix of pixels, a pretty common problem nowadays is that images could contain some noise (invalid pixels),
so most of the modern pictures applications denoised the image or make it smoother.

Your objective is to create an application that applies the denoised.



### Restrictions

- No OpenCV usage

- No Numpy/ third party libraries to apply filters.



### What you could use

- A library that is only part of the standard library of your preferred programming language to load the picture into memory.



### What would be evaluated

- Your creativity using data structures, optimization steps to play with the image.

- Your algorithms implementation and justification to decide which one to pick.
